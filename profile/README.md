## Our Focus

### Open Source Solutions

Open source software makes it possible for any interested person to further develop the source code. As a result, GLAMs gain independence from expensive, proprietary software and restrictive license agreements. In addition, the disclosure of the source code fosters transparency and security, as it is publicly accessible and verifiable. The high adaptability and reusability of open source software leads to long-term cost efficiency and allows GLAMs to implement sustainable and customized solutions.

### Progressive Web Apps

Progressive web apps (PWA) are applications that are used directly via the browser. They combine the advantages of native apps, such as easy creation, maintenance and discoverability, with additional features such as offline functionality, fast loading times and automatic updates. PWAs work across platforms and offer a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices, significantly increasing their reach and usability.

### State of the Art Development

We continuously work with the latest technological standards and integrate innovative technologies into our projects. This ensures that our developments are always up to date. This enables us to create efficient and powerful solutions that are both user-friendly and future-proof. The use of state-of-the-art tools and methods allows us to react flexibly to changes and implement creative approaches. Our products provide improved security, high scalability and optimum performance.

### Eco-friendliness

We develop our web applications and websites with lean code and a focus on minimal storage space requirements. For all projects we rely on green hosting at Greensta. These measures help to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. By optimizing our software solutions, we promote the responsible use of resources. Our customers benefit from websites and applications that are characterized by short loading times and high cost efficiency.
