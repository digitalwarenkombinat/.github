![Intro](https://digitalwarenkombinat.de/assets/about.svg.svg)

The Digitalwarenkombinat (DIWAKO) is dedicated to the creative use of open cultural data and develops web applications and merchandise for and with GLAM institutions under the motto â€žShaping digital worlds togetherâ€œ.

## Services

### Web applications
We help you to make your museumÂ´s and archiveÂ´s collections accessible to a wider public and, with the help of playful and educational web applications, to reach even those who have rarely found their way to you so far.

### Media stations
We develop media stations together with you based on your digitized collection treasures - for exhibitions as well as an application for your museum education department.

### Merchandise
Despite open licenses and public domain, far too many digitized museum treasures eke out an existence in the shadows of the internet. We want to change that and create new, analog and aesthetic products from them - so that old things can be rediscovered.

### Consulting
You have digitized and scanned your collections, but don't know what to do with them? We accompany and advise you and develop ideas together with you for a creative use of your cultural data.
